# test-one

This is a foundational QA automation project created as part of my 30 Days to Automation journey. It uses Git for version control and will evolve into a full-featured mobile and web testing framework.

## 🚀 Goals
- Set up and validate Git workflows
- Build reusable automation flows with WebdriverIO and Appium v3
- Run mobile tests on Android emulators
- Expand into API and backend testing with Postman and SQL

## 📁 Current Files
- `testone.txt`: Initial placeholder file
- `.gitignore`: (coming soon)
- `README.md`: You’re reading it!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- WebdriverIO
- Appium v3
- Node.js
- Git & GitHub
- Postman (for API validation)

## 📌 Next Steps
- Add `.gitignore` to clean up commits
- Create `tests/` folder for automation scripts
- Add sample test flows for Android apps
